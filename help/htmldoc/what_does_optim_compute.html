<h2> What Does OptiM Compute? </h2>
<p class="sansserif"> OptiM is aimed at assisting with the linear optics design of particle accelerators, including
  linear space charge effects. The program can also be used for particle tracking,
  in which case non-linear elements are accounted for.
</p>

<h3> Outline of the Program Features and Capabilities : </h3> 
<ul class="sanserif">
  <li>  All linear optics calculations are based on $6 \times 6$  transfer matrices. 
  <li>  Dispersion and betatron functions (uncoupled or coupled (X/Y) particle motion) </li>
  <li>  Beam sizes </li>
  <li>  Betatron phase advances </li>
  <li>  Results can be plotted or printed along a reference trajectory, or at the dowstream end(s) of a selection of element(s).</li>
  <li>  Parameters of accelerator elements can be iteratively adjusted to fit prescribed optical functions (matching). 
    The matching operation can be performed either for a transport line, where initial Twiss parameters are fixed
    or for a ring, where Twiss parameters are periodic. </li>
  <li>  All calculated values are nominally referenced to a moving coordinate frame attached to the central (design) beam orbit.</li>
  <li>  If desired, the program can calculate and output the position of this reference frame in global
  coordinates. </li>  
  <li>  A wide variety of elements is provided to support the design of  linear accelerators, recirculators
       or circular synchrotron accelerators. </li>
  <li> A simple input syntax  and a well-developed set of menus minimize the amount of time needed to learn the program. </li>
  <li>  Not limited to small machines; all necessary measures have been taken to support design and optics studies of very large machines
    consisting of thousands of elements. </li>
  <li> Interactive: In complex situations where a designer cannot formulate a full set of requirements
  in the early stage of a design, working in interactive mode can significantly improve productivity.   </li>
  <li> particle tracking in presence of non-linear magnetic fields in accelerator magnets </li>
  <li> beam space charge in the KV-distribution (linear space charge field) approximation.</li>
  <li> Computations can be performed not only on the design orbit but also on any reference orbit defined by machine errors 
  (e.g quad offsets or errors in dipole bend strength), correctors or energy offset. In this case, a new "reference" orbit
  is established and maps for machine elements obtained from an expansion about this new orbit (see Optics Calculations at Reference Orbit and Control). </li>
  <li> Linear optics computations (tunes, beta-functions, etc.) and non-linear tracking can be performed relative to a 
    reference orbit. </li>
 </ul>
