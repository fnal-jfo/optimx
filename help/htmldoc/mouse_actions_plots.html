<h2>Graphical Window</h2>

<p> Although there are different types of plot windows, all of them have similar functionality. 
  Color coded curve legends are placed at the bottom of the window. Pressing the left mouse button on a curve legend
  switches the corresponding curve on or off. The horizontal axis (abcissa) is usually the coordinate (measured in meters) along the beam line.
  Location and length of magnets are overlayed on the top part of the plot (lego plot).
  Hovering the pointer over an element in the logo plot displays its name and sequence index;
  the information is also provided for the next downstream element. This feature is useful to identify elements that (for example a  quad)
  have very small or even zero length.
  There are two vertical axes (ordinates) on the left and on right sides of the plot.
  The plotted quantities and and associated units are always displayed. Some windows make use of both axes and some of them use
  only the left axis.
  A plot zoomed by pressing the left button and dragging the mouse.
  A left double click on the plot canvas restores the plot to its original size.
  Clicking the left mouse button on the top border plot provides a system menu. Some of the options are standard and self-explanatory.
  Detach - detaches window from output. If necessary, a detached window can be re-attached to the output stream. Both attached and detached windows
  can be printed and copied to the clipboard. To get the current mouse position (in the plot units) click the right mouse button.
  When a plot is shown,  the vertical coordinate is digitized for the left vertical axis.
  One can switch it to the right vertical scale (and vise versa) by left mouse click on the capture of the right (left) axis.
  It will change its highlighting from gray to green. 
  Click of the right mouse button in the top part of the window will pops up a dialog window for a file name which data will be plotted inside this window.
  After the file is chosen the second dialog box is popped up to determine how data should be plotted. Up to eight files can be read.
  This option allows one to read measured data into the window and, consequently, to perform a comparison of measured and calculated properties of the lattice
  (Fitting to Measurements) and can be used for other applications as well. Data, which are read into different graphical windows, belongs to corresponding
  windows and are independent. The data are deleted when a window is closed. 
  Double click in the same top aria of the window brings a dialog box, which allows one to delete the last piece of data and/or to
  switch off the legend of files read into the window.
  You can save plot data to a text file. To do so, select the desired window; then choose File| Save As
