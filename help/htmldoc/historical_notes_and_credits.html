<h2> Historical Notes and Credits </h2> 
<p>OptiM was authored as an MS Windows centric application starting in the early 1990s by Valeri Lebedev (val@fnal.gov);
  he continued to maintain and further develop it until 2014. The original code relied on the Borland C++ OWL
  framework which is now obsolete and no longer available as a commercial product. During the last quarter of 2014,
  the OptiM code base was ported to the multi-platform Qt framework and modified to better conform to modern C++ usage
  by J.-F. Ostiguy (ostiguy@fnal.gov). Both the look-and-feel and functionality of the original Windows/OWL application
  have been preserved.
