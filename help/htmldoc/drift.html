<p>
  While a drift element (type "O") has a single argument, namely the length of the drift in cm, 
  the Instrument (type "I") is meant to be used for beam instrumentation e.g. beam position
  monitor, etc ... and is analogeous to the "monitor" element of DIMAD and MAD.
  Basically, it is an element which while behaving optically like a drift,  needs to be
  distinguishible from generic empty space. Elements of type "I"  allow a second argument.
  Although refered to as "tilt angle", it is not used in any OptiM calculations.
  and can be used to store any type of useful information.
  A possible application would be to use it as a flag to distinguish between horizontal
  and vertical BPMs. Even though it has no effect, the value of the "T" attribute is
  printed from the View|Lattice menu.

Example: 
O    		L[cm]=136 
otarget		=10
iIPM1A23   	L[cm]=1        	Tilt[deg]=90  
</pre>
<p> Note that the second line is not a syntax error. Arguments are read sequentially
    and are delimited by the "=" character. The argument labels on the left hand side of "=" are
    ignored and are used only as mnemonics. In this example, the second line would be interpreted
    as
</p>
<pre>
otarget	L[cm]=10.
