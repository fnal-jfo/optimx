<h4>Tools|Close Lattice</h4>
<p>
  Closes the lattice (finds a periodic solution for beta-functions and dispersions). The initial Twiss parameters
  in the main window are automatically updated, assuming that the periodic solution can be found.
</p>
<h4>Tools|Close Symmetric</h4>
<p>
  Closes the lattice symmetrically i.e. force the alpha-functions and dispersion derivatives to be zero both at the lattice entrance and exit.
  If a solution can be found, the initial Twiss parameters in the main window are overwritten.
</p>
<h4>Tools|Track</h4>
<p>
Performs multi-particle, multiturn tracking. 
Invoking Tools|Tracker menu opens a Tracker window. This window provides its own menu to control the tracking object behavior.
Before tracking can be performed, general tracking parameters as well as an initial particle distribution must be specified. 
</p>
<p>
  To set the general tracking parameters, from the tracjing window menu invoke Setup|Parameters. The dialog allows one to specify the number of turns
  and the element index (the location) for the which tracking results will be reported. A negative or zero index implies the last element of the lattice.
  A checkbox determines whether the program should use a fast tracking algorithm (the default is the most accurate one) and whether
  Tracking results (normalized beam emittances, maximum particle coordinates, and survival fraction) are shown.
  The output window is fully editable: arbitrary text e.g. comments may be added.  
</p>
<p>
  Once general tracking parameters are set, the menu items Setup|Distribution and File|Read are enabled;
  either one may be invoked to specify an initial particle distribution.
  Use Setup|Distribution to generate a Gaussian particle in 6D phase space. The following parameters can be specified in the dialog window: RMAX, RMIN and the number of particles.
  RMAX and RMIN specify the inner and outer truncation radii in 6D phase space; particles with coordinates larger than RMAX*SIGMA or less than RMIN*SIGMA
  will be excluded. By setting RMAX close to RMIN, a spherical "shell" particle distribution in 6D space may be generated. The defaults are RMAX=6, RMIN=0.
  Other parameters for the transverse and longitudinal distributions (bunch length, energy spread and alpha) are prescribed in the 4D Beta-functions block
  and the space charge block (see Space Charge Menu).
  The 4D Beta-function block entries determine the transverse particle distribution, which is, in general, considered to be X-Y coupled
  (see 4D Beta-functions block and Input language description). If the 4D block does not exist, the program, after prompting the user, creates a template.
  The correct initial 4D Twiss functions and emittances must then be explicilty specified. Alternatively, one may use View 4D|Close 4D from the menu to
  automatically obtain periodic Twiss functions for a circular machine.
  Entries from the the space charge block are used to determine the equation of ellipse in  longitudinal phase space (projection of 6D ellipsoid to the longitudinal plane):
  $$
  \frac{\Delta p^2}{\sigma_p^2} - 2\tilde{\alpha} \frac{\Delta p \Delta s}{\sigma_p\sigma_s} + \frac{\Delta_s^2}{\sigma_s^2} = 1 - \tilde{\alpha^2}
  $$
  where $\sigma_p$ and $\sigma_s$ are the energy spread and the bunch length (for definition of $\tilde{\alpha}$ see also Size4D).
  As it follows from the definition, the total longitudinal emittance is 
  $$
  \sqrt{1-\tilde{\alpha^2}} \sigma_p \sigma_s
  $$
  If the initial dispersions in the 4D Beta-function block are not zero, an additional particle displacement proportional to its momentum deviation is assigned. 
  If a special initial distribution is needed, the initial distribution can be read from a file by invoking File|Read from the Traker menu.
  The file format is as follows:
  The first line is the string "OptiM Track Data". Subsequent lines are (one line per particle) the 6 phase space coordinates: x[cm], dx/ds, y[cm], dy/ds, z[cm], Dp/p.
  The example below illustrates the required format: 
</p>
<pre>
OptiM Track Data
-0.281148  	-2.20735e-05  	0.0973784  	0.000123752  	-0.0444716  	0.000138878
....  	
-0.19935  	4.71474e-05  	-0.00284839  	-8.62216e-05  	0.199689  	0.000104129  	
</pre>
<p>
  Two additional columns may be present. Column 7 is a particle ID.  If none is assigned, it is automatically set to the particle index used internally.
  Column 8 is the statistical weight of the particle. If it is not assigned, it is set to 1.0
</p>

Once an initial particle distribution is established, tracking can be initiated. Upon completion, the initial and final phase
space distributions are available from the Views menu. Any one of the  X-Y, X-X', Y-Y', and S-dP/P  projections may be selected.
Plots of the normalized emittance, energy spread and beam intensity evolutions are available from the Plot menu.
The initial and the final particle distributions may be saved by invoking File|Save from the Tracker menu.
</p>
<h4>Tools|Trajectory</h4>
<p>
  Plots betatron motion trajectory, i.e. plots a particle trajectory relative to the reference orbit. The program uses the initial particle positions angles
  and momentum deviation specified in the trajectory parameter block, whose format is shown below:
</p>
<pre>
TrajParamBlock
	X[cm]=0. 	Teta_X[rad]=0.
	Y[cm]=0. 	Teta_Y[rad]=0.
	s[cm]=0. 	DeltaP/P=0.
EndTrajParamBlock
</pre>
<p>
If no trajectory parameter block is present, a template will automatically be created. 	
The Tools|Control menu provides some control on how the trajectory is plotted.
</p>
<h4>Tools|Type Trajectory</h4>
<p>
Analogeous to Tools|Trajectory, but provides numerical output. 
The program prompts for initial betatron amplitudes and angles, and then propagates betatron trajectory along the lattice.
Correctors kicks are accounted for. The Step parameter determines the spacing between samples. Each element
is subdivided into a finite number of equal slices. The number of slices is selected to match the step parameter as closely as possible.
A zero or negative step parameter causes the output to be produced only at the dowstream ends of elements. A filter allows one to include/exclude
specific elements from the table (See Filtering). Output can also be limited to elements from a specified range.
Setting the element indices for the start and end opf the range to zero implies that the entire lattice range is selected. 
</p>
<h4>Tools|Close Trajectory</h4>
<p>
  Determines the closed orbit for a ring where the closed orbit differs from the design orbit due to the presence of transverse and/or longitudinal correctors
  and momentum offset. This command updates the trajectory parameter block which is used by the Trajectory and Type trajectory commands.
  Tools|Control provides some control on how the trajectory closure is performed.
</p>
<h4>Tools|Tune Diagram </h4>
<p>
  Plots a tune diagram. This is another type of graphical window but its functionality is similar to the general graphical window (see Graphical Window).
  A dialog allows the used to specify the extent of the tune space (where the tune diagram has to be build), the maximum order of resonances
  (for which resonance lines are shown) and the types of resonances (sum or coupling resonances).
</p>
<h4>Tools|Show External File</h4>
<p>
  Plots numerical values from an external text file. The file must be in tabular format. Any number of spaces and tabs delimits columns. Up to four curves can be
  shown simultaneously. The dialog box is self explanatory. One needs to assign:  column for abscissa and ordinates and ordinate axis (left or right).
  If a column number is less than or equal to zero,  the corresponding curve will not be shown.  
</p>
<h4>Tools|Control</h4>
<p>
Controls the behavior of Tools|Trajectory and Tools|Close Trajectory menus. 
The first two-way radio button allows one to choose how the orbit closure in a ring will be performed. If Use single plane closure for each plane is chosen,
then only the entries of a 2-by-2 horizontal and vertical transfer matrices are used for closure; non-linear terms are ignored.
In this case, the orbit can be excited by transverse correctors only (see K-transverse corrector). If Use general 6D closure is chosen,
all non-linearities and plane-to-plane coupling are taken into account when the closed orbit is determined. In this case both transverse and longitudinal
correctors, as well as electrostatic acceleration and RF cavities affect the beam motion. If no accelerating cavities are present in a ring,
the longitudinal degree of freedom cannot be closed and one needs to check the 4D closure box. In this case only transverse coordinates are used for
the closure and one additionally needs to write down a desired momentum offset in TrajParamBlock (see Trajectory).
Three numeric parameters below Use general 6D closure button determine the iteration parameters for the 6D (or 4D) orbit closure.
The second three-way radio button allows one to choose how the trajectory is plotted. If Normal plot is chosen then the vertical and horizontal
beam displacements are plotted. If Plot beam displacement normalized by beam size is chosen then the program plots the beam
displacements normalized by the beam sizes (x/Ax and y/Ay). And if Plot beam displacement together with beam boundaries is chosen the program, in addition to the beam centroids,
plots the beam boundaries (x, x+Ax, x-Ax, and y, y+Ay, y-Ay). For the last two choices the beam size is computed the same way as for View| Sizes menu,
i.e. the eighth check box of View|Control menu determines either the betatron beam size or the total beam size should be used.
