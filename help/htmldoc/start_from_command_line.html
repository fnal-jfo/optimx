<h2>Lauching the Program from the File Manager or Command Line</h2>

<p> The program accepts as a parameter the a name of lattice (*.opt) file. This mechanism allows one to launch
  the program from the File Manager  (a.k.a. Windows Explorer in Windows XP and later) by double clicking
  on a file with the *.opt extension; or simply from the command line prompt by typing the program file name and the OptiM file name 
  e.g. </p>
  <pre>
  optim astrid.opt
  </pre>
  
<p> To associate the *.opt extension (under MS Windows) involves the following steps </p>
<ul>
<li> Open Windows Explorer </li>
<li>	Chose View|Options menu </li>
<li>	Press File Types tab </li>
<li> 	Press New Type button </li>
<li> 	Write  OptiM  as file description type </li>
<li> 	Write  .opt  as associated extension </li>
<li> 	Press New </li>
<li> 	Write  Open for Action </li>
<li> 	Browse to OptiM .exe file </li>
</ul>
<p> An equivalent procedure would have to be followed on other platforms.</p>
